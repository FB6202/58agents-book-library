- unique book title
- unique user email address
- every loan should have at least one book
- books have another attribute (available), that is updated every time a loan comes in
- almost the complete validation and functionality is performed in the backend

-> considering that the data transfer objects coming from the client minimize error possibilities
-> validation would be performed on both sides!
